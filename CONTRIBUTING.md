1. Fork this repository ([Forking a Repo](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo))

1. Commit your changes
1. Create a pull request ([How to create a Pull Request](https://opensource.com/article/19/7/create-pull-request-github))

## Picking an Issue

If you decide to fix an issue, please be sure to check the comment thread in case somebody is already working on a fix. If nobody is working on it at the moment, please leave a comment stating that you intend to work on it so other people don’t accidentally duplicate your effort.

If somebody claims an issue but doesn’t follow up for more than two weeks, it’s fine to take it over but you should still leave a comment.

## Branch Name

Create a branch according to the issue that you're working on. The naming convention is as following:

`TYPE-ISSUE_ID-DESCRIPTION`

example:

```
feat-56-add-contributing-guidelines
```

When `TYPE` can be:

- **feat** - is a new feature
- **doc** - documentation only changes
- **fix** - a bug fix
- **refactor** - code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature

**All PRs must include a commit message with the changes description!**

## Pull Request

The core team is monitoring for pull requests. We will review your pull request and either merge it, request changes to it, or close it with an explanation.

When creating a pull request, make sure all the prior functionality still working as intended. Remove any unecessary comments, log, or dead code. Attach a screenshot if your changes is related to UI changes. Don't forget to describe what are the changes in that pull request.
